# Human Freedom Project
Freedom can be defined differently by individuals. Today, human freedom can be associated with different circumstances such as economic or social. This study analyzes how human freedom can be evaluated globally by various measures. To answer this question, Human Freedom Index is used. This index is a large collection of different measurements of 162 countries. The more details about these countries and their religions are shown in the data description part. The methods of data collection and used statistical test are evaluated in the methodology part. Analysis part includes the following analysis:

:heavy_check_mark: Human Scores by Regions

:heavy_check_mark: The Highest and The Lowest Human Freedom Scores of Countries

:heavy_check_mark: Legal Systems and Property Right Scores by Regions

:heavy_check_mark: Multiple Linear Regression

What can be interpreted as social-economic by looking at the results of the analysis is discussed in the conclusion and discussion part of the study.
